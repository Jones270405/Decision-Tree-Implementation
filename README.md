# Task 1: Decision Tree Implementation  
**Machine Learning Internship – EliTech**

## Overview
This project is part of **Task 1** of the **Machine Learning Internship at EliTech**.  
The objective of this task is to build, train, and visualize a **Decision Tree model** using a real-world dataset and analyze its performance.

---

## Dataset
- **Name:** Student Performance Dataset  
- **Format:** CSV file  
- **Description:**  
  The dataset contains various student-related features such as academic and personal factors, which are used to predict student performance outcomes.

---

## Problem Statement
To implement a **Decision Tree Classifier** that can learn patterns from student data and make predictions based on feature-based splits.

---

## Tools & Technologies Used
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - scikit-learn
  - matplotlib

---

## Workflow
1. Loaded and explored the Student Performance dataset  
2. Performed basic data preprocessing  
3. Selected features and target variable  
4. Split the data into training and testing sets  
5. Trained a **Decision Tree Classifier**  
6. Evaluated the model using accuracy  
7. Visualized the decision tree for interpretability  
8. Analyzed results and documented observations  

---

## Results
- The Decision Tree model achieved good accuracy on the test dataset.
- Visualization helped in understanding how different features contribute to predictions.
- Limiting the depth of the tree helped reduce overfitting.

---

## Key Learnings
- Understanding how Decision Trees work internally  
- Importance of feature-based splits  
- Model interpretability using visualization  
- Applying machine learning models to real-world datasets  

---

## Conclusion
This task strengthened my foundation in **supervised machine learning** and improved my confidence in implementing and analyzing classification models using Python.
